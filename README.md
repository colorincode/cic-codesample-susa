# About This project

# Unique challenges
- This code had to largely be reproduced from an incomplete React repository, there was a working live copy at the time, but didn't work when reproduced locally in multiple environments. Overcame this by unifying build and code, syncing server, (private) repos, and clearing json entries that were incomplete or not previously correct. Some design changes were made after production, which introduced a couple layout issues, resolved within the JS/CSS.
